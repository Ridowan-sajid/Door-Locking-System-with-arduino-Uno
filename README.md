# Door-Locking-System-with-arduino-Uno


## Project Objectives:  

**The objective of this project is to make a secure door locking system to keep safe our house, apartment, office and many more with low cost. Because of lock system intruders wouldnâ€™t be able to enter through the door. With alert system burglars and intruders can be caught red handed. In this project main owner has all control of the door and can control alert system.**

**First owner have to set a secret key. If the secret key has been pressed then the door will open. If any user pressed the wrong key or password for third time or more it will create an alerm with buzzer and red light will be start blinking. After 4 times blinkging red light and buzzer will stop. After that even if user try to press the right key then again the alerm system will start. The only way to stop this, owner have to press another secret key which is also set by the owner.**
